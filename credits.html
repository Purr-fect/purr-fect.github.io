          I started programming with Python around 12 years old. I learned a lot
          more languages since, and eventually discovered Rust. This language is
          well-designed and encouraged me to study algorithms. From 12 to today,
          I never really finished any big project, and stuck to more simple
          utilities in the terminal, or extensions for my browser. I also fixed
          issues in some open source software I use. This project will let me
          achieve a big project. I never used Unity for any real project beyond
          little tests, before EPITA. Thus, I will learn how to use Unity for a
          project, and in a team.

          I learned to program when I was around 14 years old, I loved it and
          continue to work in different languages, including Python, JavaScript
          (both in node.js and in browser), Typescript, and Rust which I mainly
          use today. This project will be the first real game I will make, as I
          have made some pet project using my custom game engine. This will also
          force me to use git with collaboration in mind, as I use it
          personally. This isnâ€™t the first big project I will have, I started
          making a 2d game engine in Rust around 3 years ago and still make an
          update to it from time to time. The multiplayer aspect of games always
          interested me, I have done some networking in some of my projects, but
          I never tried doing a multiplayer game.

          I have always been passionate about programming. I started it during
          the secondary school. During that time, I programmed my first video
          game on Scratch. In High school, I learned to work in Python. I still
          mainly use it now, especially for hobbies. Indeed, in my free time, I
          make some 3D animations with Blender and Python. I think that thanks
          to the knowledge and the experience that I acquired while making my
          video game and doing my 3D animations, I can use them to help my team
          making our game with the usage of the Blender software as Iâ€™m now used
          to it. Thanks to this project, I expect to improve my skills in Unity
          because I only did a few little projects on it thanks to NTS. By doing
          this project, I hope also to gain experiences in programming in a
          team, as I have always programmed alone until today.

          I have always been passionate about overcoming complex issues. I
          recently discovered that I had passion to coding, since it has a lot
          to do with solving problems. Even though I had little to no experience
          of coding before joining EPITA, I believe that I have learned quite a
          lot throughout my first semester in EPITA. I now know how to develop a
          game in C# using Unity, and also improved my problem-solving skills.
          Through code, I am now able to design and ideate possible solutions,
          and then execute them. Even though I have done many group works
          throughout my high school, this is by far the biggest! This project
          will not only enhance my coding skills, but also foster my creativity.
          I am eager to gain new experiences, enhance my skills, and utilize
          them to give a great contribution to the group.
