    <h3>What is this game?</h3>
    <p>
      Ailouros is a kind of MOBA, inspired by successful games like Brawl Stars
      and Rocket League. Its primary game mode will be 3v3 cats. Currently, the
      best way to know what the game will be like is to look at the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/Purr-fect/Ailouros-releases/releases/download/specs/ailouros-specifications.pdf"
        >specifications</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h3>What's the project's timeline?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>28/01/2022</b>: Book of specifications accepted</li>
      <li><b>08/03/2022</b>: First defense</li>
      <li><b>25/04/2022</b>: Second defense</li>
      <li><b>06/06/2022 - 17/06/2022</b>: Final defense</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note all documents on the game (specifications, reports) are available on
      the "downloads" page
    </p>

    <h3>Did y'all overcome some big issues?</h3>
    <p>
      For the first defense, a member was unavailable for personal reasons. We
      also had to go through all the documentation of our multiplayer library to
      understand what we were doing (Mirror).
    </p>

    <h3>Why are you creating this amazing game?</h3>
    <p>
      We're first-year EPITA students, and we were tasked to create some game
      for our second semester.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is behind this game?</h3>
    <p>
      We are four EPITA students, and for more information you can find the full
      credits <a href="credits.html">here</a>.
